Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is a personal homepage with a little portfolio, todo list, and contacts.
To create the main silhouette of these pages I used Flexbox. Bootstrap grid system
has been implemented on the todo page.
The project consists of:

- index.html (inc: image)
- portfolio.html (inc: table)
- todo.html (inc: bootstrap grid)
- contacts.html (inc: bootstrap comp)
- style.scss
- style.css

P.S. English is not my native language. Sorry for the possible mistakes.
